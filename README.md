# LSTM

All purpose OOP implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network, using TensorFlow. The model was initially produced for my Undergraduate Thesis in predicting stock price movements. It has been designed in a highly encapsulated form (including completely hiding the TensorFlow Session within the class) with many user-customisable parameters defining the network's model, allowing it to be easily adjusted and applied to any time-series prediction task.
